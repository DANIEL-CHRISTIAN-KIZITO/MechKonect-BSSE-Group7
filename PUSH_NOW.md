# Push Backend Files to GitHub - Final Step

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

All backend files have been:

- ✅ Added to git
- ✅ Committed
- ✅ Repository configured for KAKOOZAMICHAEL/contribution-MechKonet-App

## 🚀 Final Step: Push to GitHub

Run this command in your terminal:

```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 When Prompted for Credentials:

**Username:** `KAKOOZAMICHAEL`

**Password:** [Your Personal Access Token - NOT your GitHub password]

### How to Get Personal Access Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "MechKonect Upload"
4. Select scope: **`repo`** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)
7. Paste it when prompted for password

## 📍 After Successful Push:

View your files at:

- Repository: https://github.com/KAKOOZAMICHAEL/contribution-MechKonet-App
- Backend folder: https://github.com/KAKOOZAMICHAEL/contribution-MechKonet-App/tree/main/backend

## ⚠️ If Push Fails:

1. **Wrong credentials**: Make sure username is `KAKOOZAMICHAEL` and password is your token
2. **Repository doesn't exist**: Create it at https://github.com/new (name: `contribution-MechKonet-App`)
3. **Token expired**: Generate a new token at https://github.com/settings/tokens

## Quick Command:

```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

Then enter:

- Username: `KAKOOZAMICHAEL`
- Password: `[paste your token]`
